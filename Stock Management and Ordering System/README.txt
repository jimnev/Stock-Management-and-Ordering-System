James Neville Stock Management and Ordering System
***************************************************

This system allows users to view the current stock in the business 
and generate sales and orders. If a manager user is logged in
the can set up a new user, add stock and update stock.

To log in as a manager enter the following on the login page:

username: jsmith
password: abcd


To log in as an employee enter the following on the login page:

username: jryan
password: 1234

If a new user is set up when logged in as the manager, this can be used
straight away to log in.

The .mdf file (master database file) is included in the submission folder.
This can be attached to the users database management system to use and view the database.
When attaching this file the .ldf file needs to be removed (if it is added with it), 
otherwise the attach will fail.
